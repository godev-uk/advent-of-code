# Advent of Code

Advent of Code solutions in Go.

I am solving these problems for fun and to demonstrate Go solutions.

These are not necessarily the most efficient, elegant or robust solutions. For
example, I have not tried to minimise memory usage, and I have not performed
the same level of error handling that would usually be required for a program
that takes user input, as the input is fixed and known in advance.

However, each function has at least one unit test to ensure that it produces
the correct output for a given input.

Not all days have a solution, especially as sometimes I will move on having
solved part A if I can't think how to solve part B.
